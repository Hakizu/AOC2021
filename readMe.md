About Advent of Code
--------------------

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/about) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles
for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any
programming language you like. One programming puzzle a day is released from 1st
to 25th December, divided in two parts (the second of which is unlocked after
solving the first). Advent of Code is created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/), and is
100% free. If you like Advent Of Code and want to support its creator, you can
donate to him [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021/support). If you want to hang out with other fellow
coders, discuss about puzzles and solutions, or just have a look around, you can
join the official subreddit: [r/adventofcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/), or the unofficial IRC
channel: `#adventofcode` on `irc.libera.chat`.


About this repo
--------------------

I started to solve AOC exercises in the beginning of 2020 and still have a long way to go.
As a personal challenge I try to solve those puzzles with python (even though I've never coded anything in python).
Solutions will most likely not be the most efficient way to solve these exercises.
However they were the best I could come up with at the time.

If you have question or spotted a typo/bug/mistake or a more efficient way of solving a problem,
you are most welcome to [submit a new issue](https://github.com/Hakizu/AOC2021/issues/).

Cheers
